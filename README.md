## Skills and Experience Acquired

- 🚀 **Created and Demoed Machine Learning Applications**: I learned how to quickly create and demonstrate machine learning applications.

- 🖼️💡 **Built Image Generation and Captioning Apps**: I built my own image generation and image captioning apps, as well as text-summarization applications.

- 🌐🤝 **Shared Apps on Hugging Face Spaces**: I shared my app with teammates, beta testers, and others on Hugging Face Spaces.


## Skills Acquired in the "Building Generative AI Applications with Gradio" Course

🤗 **Learned from Apolinário Passos at Hugging Face**: I joined the short course and learned from Apolinário Passos, Machine Learning Art Engineer at Hugging Face.

### Projects Completed:

- 📝🔍 **Created a Text Summarization App**: Developed a user-friendly app, usable by non-coders, to take input text, summarize it with an open-source large language model, and display the summary.

- 🖼️📜 **Built an Image to Text Description App**: Created an app that allows users to upload an image. The app uses image captioning to describe the uploaded image and displays both the image and the caption.

- 🎨📸 **Generated Images from Text with a Diffusion Model**: Developed an app that takes text input and generates an image with a diffusion model, displaying the generated image within the app.

- 🔄 **Combined Image Captioning and Image Generation**: Combined lessons learned to create an app where users upload an image, caption the image, and then use the caption to generate a new image.

- 💬🤖 **Chat Interface with Falcon LLM**: Built an interface to chat with Falcon, the best-ranking open-source LLM on the Open LLM Leaderboard.

### Course Outcome:

- 🚀 **Practical Knowledge for Building Interactive Apps**: By the end of the course, I gained practical knowledge to rapidly build interactive apps and demos, validating projects and shipping faster.
